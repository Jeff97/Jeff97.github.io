I am currently a **Postdoc** at the School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, **South China University of Technology (SCUT)**, working with **Prof. Xiaohu Yao**.

My research interests focus on **Soft Matter Mechanics**, **Plate and Shell Theory**, **Growth Deformation Control**, **Mixed Finite Element Methods**, and **ABAQUS Subroutine Development**. Specifically, I am interested in the analytical study of growth deformation in plate/shell-like soft materials, shape control theory based on growth deformation, and numerical simulation of multi-field coupled growth behaviors.

## Research Highlights

### 1. Analytical Solution of the Forward Problem of Growth Deformation
Growth-induced deformation is a common phenomenon in nature, such as the wrinkling of skin and the curling of leaves. We have developed a theoretical framework to analytically solve the forward problem of growth deformation in hyperelastic materials. By formulating the 3D governing equations within the finite-strain regime and employing perturbation methods or series expansions, we derived explicit analytical solutions for the growth-induced buckling and post-buckling behaviors of plates and shells. These solutions provide deep insights into the mechanism of growth-driven instabilities and pattern formation.

### 2. Analytical Solution of the Inverse Problem of Growth Deformation (Shape Control)
Precise shape control of soft materials is crucial for applications in soft robotics and biomedical engineering. We proposed a novel "stress-free growth" approach to solve the inverse problem: determining the required growth distribution to achieve a specific target shape.
*   **Conformal Mapping**: We established the analytical relationship between growth tensor fields and conformal mappings, enabling the realization of arbitrary planar and surface conformal transformations through programmed growth.
*   **General Shape Transformation**: We further extended this to general shape transformations of thin hyperelastic shells, deriving explicit formulas connecting growth functions with the geometric quantities of 3D target surfaces. This framework supports topology optimization and complex surface generation.

### 3. Numerical Simulation of Multi-field Coupled Growth Deformation
To explore the complex interactions in smart soft materials, we developed a finite element framework for **coupled magneto-mechanical growth**.
*   **Governing System**: We established a 3D governing system that integrates magnetic fields, mechanical forces, and growth dynamics.
*   **Numerical Implementation**: A robust finite element model was implemented (often involving mixed formulations for incompressibility) to simulate the coupled behaviors.
*   **Applications**: This framework has been successfully applied to simulate surface pattern modulation in magnetoactive elastomers and mimic biological morphogenesis processes (e.g., Volvox inversion), demonstrating the potential for designing adaptive and programmable soft structures.
