I am currently a **Postdoc** at the School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, **South China University of Technology (SCUT)**, working with **Prof. Xiaohu Yao**.

My research interests focus on **Soft Matter Mechanics**, **Plate and Shell Theory**, **Growth Deformation Control**, **Mixed Finite Element Methods**, and **ABAQUS Subroutine Development**. Specifically, I am interested in the analytical study of growth deformation in plate/shell-like soft materials, shape control theory based on growth deformation, and numerical simulation of multi-field coupled growth behaviors.

## Research Highlights

### 1. Analytical Solution of the Forward Problem of Growth Deformation
We developed a theoretical framework to analytically solve the forward problem of growth deformation in hyperelastic materials. By formulating 3D governing equations and employing perturbation methods, we derived explicit solutions for growth-induced buckling and post-buckling of plates and shells, providing insights into instability mechanisms and pattern formation.

### 2. Analytical Solution of the Inverse Problem of Growth Deformation (Shape Control)
We proposed a "stress-free growth" approach to solve the inverse problem for precise shape control. By establishing analytical relationships between growth tensors and target geometries, we enabled arbitrary conformal mappings and general shape transformations of thin hyperelastic shells, supporting topology optimization and complex surface generation.

### 3. Numerical Simulation of Multi-field Coupled Growth Deformation
We developed a finite element framework for **coupled magneto-mechanical growth** to explore interactions in smart soft materials. Establishing a 3D governing system integrating magnetic fields, mechanics, and growth, we simulated surface pattern modulation and biological morphogenesis (e.g., Volvox inversion), demonstrating potential for adaptive soft structures.
