I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, **South China University of Technology (SCUT)**, working with **Prof. Xiaohu Yao**.

My research interests focus on **Soft Matter Mechanics**, **Plate and Shell Theory**, **Growth Deformation Control**, **Mixed Finite Element Methods**, and **ABAQUS Subroutine Secondary Development**. Specifically, I am interested in the analytical study of growth deformation in plate/shell-like soft materials, shape control theory based on growth deformation, and numerical calculations of multi-field coupled growth deformation.
